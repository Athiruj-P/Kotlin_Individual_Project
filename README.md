### 1. INTRODUCTION
##### Prime Time by AP is a movie suggestions application which suits various android operating system devices. My inspiration for this project is my personal activity which is watching movies or TV series such as Big Bang Theory , Game of Thrones , Marvel cinematic universe.
##### In my opinion , having an application that guides you to watch something new or something that gains lots of IMDB rating might be exciting. So, Prime Time by AP is the answer for you.
